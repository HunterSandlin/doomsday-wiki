**Pre Doomsday**

Aluren is a pretty slow combo deck. To go off they need atleast 4 Mana,
:card[Aluren] and two of their combo creatures or :card[Acererak the Archlich].
This should give you enough time to find Doomsday and set up a safe kill.

Resolving Doomsday should not be too hard, Aluren plays 4 Force of Will main and
2 Force of Negation in the sideboard. That's often not enough when they also try
to set up their own kill. In game 1 one counterspell is often enought to force
your Doomsday through. In game 2 you want enough interaction to beat atleast 2
Force effects from their side and try to keep an eye out for :card[Opposition
Agent].

**Post Doomsday**

Many lists play :card[Endurance], like most green decks in the current meta, so
prepare to play around atleast one copy.

If they fought over your Doomsday, they often don't have enough resources to go
off, but that is not always the case, especially since :card[Acererak the
Archlich] joined the format. Should they still be able to go off and you have
enough cyclers in hand to cycle to Thassa's Oracle, be careful with casting it
of :card[Aluren]. You have to cast it when their combo creature is on the stack,
else they can react and combo off while the Thassa's Oracle trigger is still no
the stack.
