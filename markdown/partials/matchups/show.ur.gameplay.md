**Pre Doomsday**

Sneak and Show is one of our hardest combo matchups, but we should still be
slightly favoured.

Both ours and their deck share many similarities, but there are 2 very small but
important differences. We play :card[Dark Ritual] and need only one card to
combo off. This fact means we need less resources to combo and have to dig less
for our combo cards.

In games were you can't combo safe in turn 1 or 2 the game can evolve into a
staredown while both players dig for interaction. Discard can be very helpfull
in situations like this. But be careful, if you play a list with less cantrips,
they will sculpt their hand better than you most of the time.

In post board games they have two tricks up their sleeve, :card[Blood Moon]
effects and Ragavan. Try to keep that in mind, but it's nothing match up
defining.

**Post Doomsday**

After you resolved Doomsday only :card[Sneak Attack] can kill you. :card[Show
and Tell] is very risky for them to cast, because it's just an Oracle cost
reducer now, and if you should have no Thassa's Oracle in hand it atleast gives
you another turn to win the game. A small trick they can use, they can put Sneak
Attack into play with Show and Tell.
