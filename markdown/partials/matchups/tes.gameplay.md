**Pre Doomsday**

The epic storm or short TES is the slower combo deck in matchup. It plays no
real interaction with your combo, only protection for their own. So your
Doomsday is always safe.

TES is pretty good in playing through countermagic and is able to reset hands
with Echo of Eons. Be carefull with your countermagic, try not to waste it. It's
good to have a feeling for how far they are away from a kill, to assess the
situation.

**Post Doomsday**

Pass the turn piles are very risky against Storm decks, because the lifeloss of
:card[Doomsday] puts them in the very good position of not needing a high storm
count. With :card[Burning Wish] for :card[Grapeshot] they can easily amass
enough damage even without the 4 Mana for :card[Tendrils of Agony]. Only pass
the turn if you know they can not kill you. With :card[Burning Wish] for
:card[Grapeshot].

Since some lists started to play white, be carefull, they can cast :card[Orim's
Chant] to *mill you out*. They just cast Orim's Chant when you draw your last
card, to prevent you from casting Thassa's Oracle and you'll lose in your next
draw step.

There are many ways to play around it. Countermagic is the obvious way, but you
can also for example use your instant draws in response to your Oracle trigger.
Orim's Chant doesn't prevent you from cycling.
