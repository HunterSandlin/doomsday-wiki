**Pre Doomsday**

Do **not** keep hands without countermagic. You'll need it to protect your own
combo and fighting off theirs. With all their discard effects one free counter
is often not enough. The only reason to keep hands without protection are turn 1
kills.

When fighting their combo, try always to counter the :card[Entomb] effects,
without a good target their reanimation spells are useless. And as a little
sidenote, most lists play only 8 ways to creatures into the graveyard, but 12
reanimation spells.

**Post Doomsday**

The scariest creatures they can reanimate post Doomsday are :card[Iona, Shield
of Emeria] and :card[Ashen Rider], so try to be carefull with your lands and
don't be stingy with your lotus petals. Iona will just end the game, and you
can't do anything about that 99% of the time.
