**Pre Doomsday**

The Hogaak matchup can be pretty tricky, because they have two ways to kill you,
either with damage or with mill. They don't even have to completely mill your 60
cards, the pure on board threat of milling us is often enough to make a kill
with Doomsday impossible.

There are two iterations of Hogaak, a jund version and BUG one. The BUG versions
is scarier by far, thanks to :card[Hedron Crab].

Speed is the only way to beat Hogaak, they are just to explosive to give them
time and you don't want to play against Hedron Crab and a uncracked Fetchlands.
But you have to be very carefull when you want to cast Doomsday but with no
option to win on the same turn. :card[Bloodghasts] will always have haste after
you resolved Doomsday, so try to evaluate the damage they can put out after you
resolved Doomsday and passed the turn.

They don't play any sideboard hate for Doomsday, but countermagic is still very
important to keep them in check and protect your combo.

**Post Doomsday**

Because Hogaak plays no cards to interact with you on the stack, outside of
Hedron Crab + Fetchland, you can build Brainstorm piles when ever you have the
resources to do so. Should you have to pass the turn, make sure you have answers
at your disposal.
