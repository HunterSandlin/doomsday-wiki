**Pre Doomsday**

OmniTell is a lot slower than it's sister Sneak and Show, since it plays only
:card[Show and Tell] and no Sneak Attack. It also plays only 4 counterspells
most of the time. That's overall very positive for us. Not much protection is
needed and we have time to set up, but a lost counter war over Doomsday, can
have harsh consequences if they fetch :card[Surgical Extraction] from their
Sideboard with :card[Cunning Wish].

**Post Doomsday**

You can build pretty safe piles that either use their Show and Tell to put
Thassa's Oracle into play or just cast it of Cavern of Souls.

Some Omni-Tell lists play :card[Trickbind] in their Sideboard. Try to use
discard spells to get rid of it if necessary.
