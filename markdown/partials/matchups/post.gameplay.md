**Pre Doomsday**

This will be a short one. Just cast Doomsday asap and play around possible
:card[Mindbreak Trap]s in sideboarded games.

Some lists play the :card[Dark Depths] Combo. Like in any Dark Depths deck,
their plays to creat a 20/20 are super telegraphed.

**Post Doomsday**

They only have one card to interact with you, :card[Endurance]. You should
always have enough time for a pile that beats Endurance and even plays around
:card[Mindbreak Trap].
