**Pre Doomsday**

Jeskai Ragavan is a very undefined archetype at the moment. There many builds
out there, from tempo style list, over midrange variants, to more controling
builds.

The matches against this deck play pretty similar to the UR Delver matchup, but
Jeskai Ragavan has often a weaker damage backup, because many lists play less or
no :card[Lightning Bolt]s combined less threats but more protection.

**Post Doomsday**

The post Doomsday part of the game is often defined by the variant you play
against or you think you play against. It's very important to try to identify
your opponents role and adapt to new information.
