**Pre Doomsday**

The matchup against Maverick plays pretty similar to the DnT mactchup, but with
a small but important difference, :card[Green Sun's Zenith]. It gives them the
opportunity to find their silverbullets very easily. Since there are no real
stock Maverick lists at the moment expect every possible sideboard silverbullet
also in the maindeck.

Some lists play :card[Dark Depths] as an alternative win condition, but it's not
super common and the Dark Depths lines are all very telegraphed and easy to
spot.

**Post Doomsday**

Like against most green Decks :card[Endurance] is the only real threat to your
easy win.

That's why it's super important to build safe piles. As long as you resolved
Doomsday early, there is no reason to get fancy.

Fetches are strong against :card[Wasteland] and :card[Collector Ouphe], so try
to stay away from petals as your mana sources for :card[Thassa's Oracle].
