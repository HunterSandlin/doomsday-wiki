**Pre Doomsday**

Similar to Hogaak it's a race or die matchup, but Madness has zero interaction.
They just slam and hope it's enough, and we do the same.

:card[Lion's Eye Diamond] is a very scary card in their deck, that leads to
super explosive turns. It should be countered 90% of the time. Always try to
evaluate their first enabler. How much damage does it really represent? Or is it
just a bait to sneak a Lion's Exe Diamond through your countermagic.

:card[Daze] should be used with care. Only use it if the set back of bouncing
your own land isn't too big and doesn't cost you the opportunity of a same turn
kill with :card[Brainstorm].

Should they have :card[Mindbreak Trap] in hand post sideboard, it's often pretty
obvious, because it's very hard for them to keep interaction up while playing
out their threats.

**Post Doomsday**

Their only ways to put hasty threats onto the board are :card[Vengevine] or
:card[Anger] + a Mountain. This makes it very easy to predict their damage and
if it's safe to pass the turn.
