**Pre Doomsday**

Lands has super strong mana denial, even more in Game 2 and 3, and will propably
always win the long game, but it can switch gears super fast thanks to
:card[Dark Depths].

Based on that analysis a fast Doomsday is the way to go. But when you are
mulliganing keep in mind, how strong countermagic is against their post
sideboard hate pieces.

**Post Doomsday**

You have 3 main objectives post Doomsday. Have enough mana to cast
:card[Thassa's Oracle]. Beat :card[Pyroblast]. Beat :card[Endurance]. Building
piles against Lands isn't always easy, and sometimes you have to take some
risks, but if you play to your objectives in the priority they are listes above,
you should be on a good way to win.

You have to learn assess your opponents posibilities, that's not something
you'll learn reading this guide. You need to play matches over matches to refine
this skill. But i can give you list of usefull tools you propably have in your
deck.

Fetches are great to play around mana denial. You can "hide" you mana producing
lands behind them while thinning your deck.

Free Countermagic is your best tool against every form hate spells. From
:card[Endurance] over :card[Choke] to :card[Sphere of Resistance].

Artifact mana is super good when you want to end the game fast and you know they
don't have ways to mess with it.

:card[Cavern of Souls] is an easy out to :card[Pyroblast]. Bounce Spells are the
way to go to beat a fast Marit Lage.
