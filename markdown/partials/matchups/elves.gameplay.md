**Pre Doomsday**

Since :card[Allosaurus Shepherd] removed all interaction in this matchup, it's
just racing and countering a :card[Thoughtseize] or :card[Deafening Silence] if
necessary. But should you have to possibility to counter something without
losing too much speed, it's often adviced to slow them down by denying them
important combo cards like :card[Elvish Visionary] or :card[Heritage Druid].

They can set up some super fast kills, either with Allosaurus Shepherd and
enough mana or with :card[Natural Order]. So be carefull and try to finish the
game as fast as possible.

**Post Doomsday**

Passing the turn piles can be a tad risky, because Elves can be really
explosive. Especially Turn 3 or later. Try to build fast piles.

In the past some Elves lists played :card[Endurance] or :card[Crop Rotation] for
:card[Ipnu Rivulet], but as long as they stay absent from sideboards, you only
have to play around :card[Collector Ouphe].
