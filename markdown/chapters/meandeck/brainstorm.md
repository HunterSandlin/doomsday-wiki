In the basics we alluded to the use of Brainstorm as being a special case when
discussing the use of cantrips to draw into our Doomsday piles. More than a
cantrip to start consuming your piles, Brainstorm can effectively draw 3 cards
at once from said pile unlike other options from your suite of cantrips. This,
combined with otherwise *dead* cards from hand can turn a resource light turn
into a winning line.

With limited initial resources, if stranded on mana against Wasteland or
opposing Rishadan Port activations you can still combo out with only a
Brainstorm post-Doomsday as long as you have an extra card in hand to put back.

## Brainstorm Available

> {B}{B}{B} + Brainstorm + X

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!Pdt}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</row>

1. Cast Brainstorm and put back X then Predict on top
1. Cast LED, cycle SW cracking LED for {U}{U}{U} and draw the Predict
1. Target yourself with Predict naming X and drawing the rest of the pile
1. The Lotus Petal gives you a second {U} to cast TO with an empty library

In the worked example above, you effectively turn the Brainstorm and the
superfluous card into {U}{U}{U} plus a way to draw into your 2 mana draw spell,
in this instance Predict.

Another example is presented here using Ideas Unbound.

> {B}{B}{B} + Brainstorm + X

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!IU}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</row>

1. Cast Brainstorm and put back X then Ideas Unbound on top
1. Cast LED, cycle SW cracking LED for {U}{U}{U} and draw the IU
1. Cast IU, drawing the rest of the pile
1. The Lotus Petal gives you a second {U} to cast TO with an empty library

## Brainstorm and *Combo Piece* Available

> {B}{B}{B} + Brainstorm + Thassa's Oracle

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!Pnd}} {{!EoA}} {{!Pnd}}</row>

You may find yourself in a scenario where you have a card in hand that is
considered *dead* outside of the combo turn. Thankfully, BS allows you to take
it out of your hand and replace it into the pile. Let us consider the example
above. It may be the opponent has a card like Scavenging Ooze out and you need
to utilize LED to generate mana but don't want to discard your one Oracle to
have it *eaten* by the Ooze. We cannot use Predict here as we would need to mill
the Oracle to do so effectively.

1. Cast Brainstorm and put back Oracle then Ponder on top.
1. Cast LED, cycle SW cracking LED for {U}{U}{U} and draw the Ponder.
1. Cast Ponder and arrange your library so that it is (EoA, TO, Pn)
1. Draw Edge, Cycle Edge and draw Oracle.
1. Cast Oracle to win.

As you can see this pile does not beat removal on Oracle as it leaves a single
card in your deck however, if you have an additional {U} available then you can
change step 3 above to arrange the deck (EoA, Pn, TO) and cast the second Ponder
with the additional {U}. Likewise, if you have another cantrip in addition to
the Oracle in hand, you can use that instead of the first Ponder in the example
and use that extra card to generate the additional {U} needed for the same
starting mana cost.

> {B}{B}{B} + Brainstorm + Thassa's Oracle + Cantrip

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!LP}} {{!EoA}} {{!Pnd}}</row>

1. Cast Brainstorm and put back Oracle then your Cantrip on top.
1. Cast LED and LP, cycle SW cracking LED for {U}{U}{U} and draw the Cantrip.
1. Cast the Cantrip and arrange your library so that it is (EoA, Pn, TO)
1. Draw Edge, Cycle Edge and draw Oracle.
1. Cast Oracle to win.

The Cantrip in the above example can be any of Ponder, Preordain or Brainstorm.
Depending on which cantrip you use changes how you perform step 3 above. If it
is Ponder, you simply rearrange the deck as there are only 3 cards left in it
during resolution. Likewise, with Brainstorm; you will draw all three cards and
replace 2 in the desired order as required. Preordain you simply *bottom* the
Oracle with the scry and draw the next card along. Another free cycler or
something like Astrolabe will not work in this position as they do not have the
deck manipulation effects needed however even something as simple as Opt can be
used.

## Free Cycler Available

It may be you find yourself with all the tools in hand to perform a Brainstorm
pile, but you don't have a spare {U} this time to cast the Brainstorm itself. If
you have any free cycler in hand you can get around this by placing a Lotus
Petal in first position of your pile. This works with a {U}-producing land as
well if you have an available land drop that turn.

> {B}{B}{B} + Brainstorm + Street Wraith + X

<row variant="pile">{{!LP}} {{!LED}} {{!EoA}} {{!Pnd}} {{!TO}}</row>

1. Cycle SW, draw the LP and cast it
1. Cast Brainstorm off of LP and put back X then Ponder
1. Cast LED, cycle SW cracking LED for {U}{U}{U} and draw the Ponder
1. Ponder for TO
1. Cast TO with the remaining mana from LED with 1 card left in your library

Similarly you can use the same as above with having a cycler in hand and {U}
available but no Brainstorm in hand. Simply exchange the resource requirements
to between what is outside the pile and the top card of the pile.

> {B}{B}{B} + {U} + Street Wraith + X

<row variant="pile">{{!BS}} {{!LED}} {{!EoA}} {{!Pnd}} {{!TO}}</row>

It follows the exact sequence as the one before but you cycle into the
Brainstorm rather into the mana needed for it. Once again, the same trick can be
done if you have excess mana or the card X is a cantrip already in exchanging
the cantrip for mana within the pile to enable the playing around of removal to
ensure you have a 0 card library on resolution of the Oracle trigger.

## Next Steps

Now you have covered the basic concepts of pile building and the use of
Brainstorm to exchange resources between hand and the pile itself, the next
stage is to start considering the interactions that can occur with an opponent
trying to prevent you resolving Doomsday itself or any of the cards within a
given pile.
