** Contributing with Content

The following sections will describe how to contribute for specific content
within the Wiki.

Pull request only.

*** Markdown

**** Pages

The Markdown is located under =markdown/=.

- =appendices/= :: Extra-resources that serve as reference for new players and
                   seasoned pilots alike.
- =archive/=    :: Old content that no longer presents relevance due to bannings
                   or else.
- =articles/=   :: Dated reports and theories.
- =authors/=    :: Contributors.
- =chapters/=   :: Most of the content goes there, organized in chapters and
                   pages.
- =partials/=   :: Some static content within the Wiki comes from those
                   partials, this avoids having to maintain content alongside
                   code.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*Note*  
Adding Markdown content in the following directories automatically creates new
pages and route URLs: =appendices/=, =articles/=, =chapters/=.  
URLs follow the file paths. Follow existing conventions.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*Note*  
In order to add a new chapter make sure you don't forget to add the
corresponding entry in the sidebar component.
#+END_QUOTE

**** Mana

The Markdown supports a number of inline shorthands in order to easily insert
Mana symbols.

#+BEGIN_SRC
{W}{U}{B}{R}{G} {C} {S} {X}{Y}{Z} {0}{1}{2}{3} ... {20}
{1}{U/B}{U/B} {U/P} {2/U}{2/U}{2/U} {X}{R} {tap} {+1}{+0}{-5}
#+END_SRC

**** Scryfall

You can link cards within content thanks to [[https://scryfall.com/][Scryfall]].
Wrap a card's name with double curly braces for a simple link ={{Doomsday}}=.

Add a =!= to insert a scan instead: ={{!Doomsday}}=. You can also specify the
set: ={{!Doomsday|WTH}}=.

**** Piles

**** Banners

The banners you've seen for articles don't have to be of a specific resolution
nor file format, use common sense. A reliable way of downloading cropped out
arts is to use Scryfall's API:

https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?exact=dark+ritual&set=leb

The above link should yield a JSON object where you will find an entry for an
adequately sized file. For more details about how to query the API, see the
official documentation: https://scryfall.com/docs/api .

** Contributing with Code

Issues and/or pull requests work best.

*** Installation

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*Note*  
This assumes you have a working setup for a standard Node application.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
yarn
yarn start
#+END_SRC

Alternatively, if you want to browse the local instance of the application from
another machine, use =yarn start:exposed= instead.

Install some kind of ESLint-compatible linter on your editor and follow
=.eslintrc.json= as well as the existing conventions.

*** Project Layout

The React code is located under =src/=.

- =components/= :: Re-usable components, one component does one job.
- =contexts/=   :: React contexts to dispatch dynamic data accross all children
                   components.
- =pages/=      :: Gatsby pages.
- =tools/=      :: Internal libraries.
- =html.js=     :: Overwrite Gatsby's default application root.
- =reset.scss=  :: Simple and naive style reset.
- =theme.js=    :: Custom Material-UI theme.

*** Commit Conventions

** Deployment

These 2 branches are automatically deployed upon commit.

- =:master= deploys to
  [[https://master--ddftwiki.netlify.app][https://master\--ddftwiki.netlify.app]]
- =:production= deploys to https://ddftwiki.netlify.app

A DNS alias for the production address points to the official domain for the
Wiki https://ddft.wiki.
